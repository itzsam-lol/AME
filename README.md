# AI-Powered Business Assistant for MSMEs

An AI-driven platform designed to help Indian micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) digitize and automate their business operations — including billing, payments, inventory, and analytics.

---

## Overview
Most MSMEs in India still rely on manual methods for bookkeeping, payments, and inventory management. This project explores how AI and automation can simplify these processes, making business management more efficient, affordable, and accessible for small business owners.

---

## Core Features (Planned)
- Automated billing and payment reminders  
- Smart income and expense tracking  
- Inventory and stock management  
- Voice-based data entry (English/Hindi)  
- AI-driven analytics and insights  
- Offline-first capability for low-connectivity areas  

---

## Research & Insights
The project combines:
- **Primary Surveys** with local business owners (retail, service, and trade sectors).  
- **MSME Reports (2023–24)** and *Digital MSME Scheme* data from the Ministry of MSME, Government of India.  
These studies highlight digital adoption barriers such as cost, usability, and trust — guiding our design choices toward simplicity and practicality.

## Tech Stack (Proposed)
- **Frontend:** React / Flutter  
- **Backend:** FastAPI / Node.js  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / Firebase  
- **AI Modules:** Python (NLP & automation)
